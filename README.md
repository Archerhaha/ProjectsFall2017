This is a repository that contains the list of links of the repositories of the projects.

To add the link of your repository, you need to fork this repository, create a file containing the link to your repository, and create a pull request (PR) from this fork. Here are the detailed steps:

1. Creating a fork:

  2. Choose your account.
2. Add the link to your fork repository:
  1. In the repository you just forked, click **Create new file**.
  2. Name it as **_(The name of your project)_.md**.
  3. Type the link of the repository of your project in the following format:
  4. **\[_The name of your project_\]\(_The url of the repository_\) by _your names_**. See ExampleProject.md as an example by editing it (by clicking the pen icon).
  5. Commit new file.
  6. Check if it has the same format as our example.
3. Create a pull request from a fork:
  1. Navigate back to the original repository (This one).
  2. To the right of the Branch menu, click **New pull request**.
  3. On the Compare page, click **compare across forks**.
